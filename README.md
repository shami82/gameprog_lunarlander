# Hot Balloon Lander

## Controls
- Player/Balloon
 - [W] to accelerate up
 - [A] to accelerate left
 - [D] to accelerate right
- Other
 - [SPACE] to restart the game

## Rules
- Land on any of the landing pads to win
- Landing on any other area of the map will crash your balloon
- Avoid the birds when moving around, otherwise your balloon crashes
- Once you run out of fuel, your balloon crashes

## Misc
- Only acceleration is controlled, so drifting occurs even when no keys are pressed
- The basket of your balloon is its weak point
- Only landing on tiles will cause you to lose; hitting hills won't hurt you
